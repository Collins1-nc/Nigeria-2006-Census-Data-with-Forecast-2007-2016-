# Nigeria 2006 Census Data with Forecast (2007-2016)

#### Project Overview 

- Introduction
This project analyzes Nigeria's 2006 census data alongside forecasted population estimates for the years 2007 to 2016. The dataset includes age group distributions from the 2006 census, but the sex ratio is only provided in the forecast for 2007-2016. Additionally, the annual growth rate (GR) was calculated only for 2006, and it was not applied in the population projections for subsequent years. This creates some limitations in analyzing long-term demographic trends.

- Objective
The goal of this project is to explore Nigeria's population structure using actual 2006 census data and forecasted estimates for 2007-2016. The focus will be on analyzing age group proportion and sex ratio projections, while recognizing the absence of a sex ratio in the 2006 census and the lack of an updated annual growth rate (GR) for the forecast period. The project aims to provide insights into the reliability of forecasts and demographic changes in the absence of continuous data updates.

### Data Source
 The data source used for this analysis is the "POPULATION PROJECTION Nigeria" Excel file, containing detailed information about the Nigeria 2006 census dataset and forecasted data (2007-2016).

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- Power BI â€“ Data Visualization, Data Transformation, & Data Cleaning

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the Initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Removing irrelevant cells and colours
- Handling missing and duplicate values
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Created some necessary columns, Date Table, and Look Up Table

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.	What is the population in 2006 and 2016?
2.	What is the male and female proportion ratio in 2016?
3.	What is the annual growth rate of each state?
4.	What is the proportion of age category?
5.	What is the yearly sex ratio of the gender?
6.	What is the population trend over the years?


### Results/Findings

- The 2006 population census shows that the actual population is 140.43 million as against the forecasted population in 2016 which is 193.50 million. 

- The male population ratio his higher than that of the female from 2006 to 2016 with 2016 male population ratio being higher than the female, 98.69 million and 94.82 million respectively.  

- The 2006 population census shows that Kano state has the highest population while Abuja has the lowest population but from the 2016 forecast, Kano state has the highest population while Bayelsa has the lowest, also, Abuja has the highest growth rate of 9.3% from the 2006 population census which. 


### Limitations 

- Growth Trends: While the Growth Rate (GR) was calculated for 2006, its absence in the forecast period makes it difficult to assess true population growth between 2007 and 2016.

- Demographic Shifts: Age group trends are explored based on the 2006 data, but the analysis of sex ratios is limited to the forecasted data, which introduces uncertainty when comparing with the actual census.

- Forecast Reliability: The lack of continuous Growth Rate (GR) and the absence of a sex ratio in the original census highlight limitations in the forecasting process, suggesting that projections should be used with caution.

### Recommendations

- Update the Forecast Model: Revise the forecast using the dynamic growth rates based on the post-2006 data from sources like National Population Commission or United Nations. This will improve accuracy by considering factors like migration and urbanization.

- Negative Effect of Overpopulation: The 2006 population census to 2016 population forecast, shows that in 10 years, the population has increased with 50 million and when compared with the economy and Internal Generated Revenue of the country, leads to economic meltdown, increase in crime rate, unemployment, and illiteracy because there are no resources to maintain the population surge. I recommend birth control policy by the government to help curb the population.

### Conclusion
This project presents an analysis of Nigeria's 2006 census data and the forecasted population estimates for 2007-2016. While the data provides valuable insights into population trends, annual growth rate, age category and so on, the absence of a sex ratio in the 2006 census and the lack of an updated annual growth rate in the forecast period limit the accuracy of long-term demographic projections. Future forecasting models would benefit from integrating ongoing updates to key demographic variables to ensure more reliable projections.
